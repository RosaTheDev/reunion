I think that the point of this activity was to put together some of the things we learned throughout the mod and build something that could be actually somewhat useful and could have a purpose.

I tried to follow the spec, but without knowing too much on how to manipulate hashes, since I'm not there yet, I had a lot of trouble and did not get far at all. what I tried to do was to give my initialize method an argument so thaty we can input what type of activity we want to give in our new instance of activity then it would line up with what we told it in the new instance of a class in our test.
I've also set participants to an empty array and tried setting the cost of the activites to a default of 0, the problem that I was having is not understanding how to put things into an empty array and that is something I need to work on. 

The most difficult portion of this excercise is to figure out how to put things into an empty array, I'm honestly not sure if I could even get through the entire challenge even if I knew how to put things into an empty array.

The only thing that came naturally was setting up the test.
